## Running locally

The current configuration runs by the server serving the client code. It is also possible to run both client and server without the server serving the client.
If you wish to tun the client you to do this by running 'npm start' from the client directory.

### Get the boilerplate project

1. Create your own github user, you can connect to it with user password (2 step authentication) or create an ssh key (configuration - https://github.com/settings/profile)
   
   a. Creating SSH key - [SSH KEY instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

   b. Install a two factor authentication app (like Authenticator) on you phone, 
      configure it in github (https://github.com/settings/security), 
      and use it to connect (you will be asked for a user password when you try to push code)


2. Fork this project to your repository (creates a copy)
3. Clone it to your local computer (downloads the project)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<you user name>/Queen-B-Bootcamp-Example.git (you can get link for the project in the website)
```

### Client side 

1. open a terminal and cd to the client
```
$ cd client
```
2. add dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

3. Build the client, in the package.json file there's a command called build, this command will run it

```
$ npm run build 
```

4. When running in development mode in order to see the errors - debug and work locally, after running the server run: (and open the web page on 3000 port)

```
$ npm start
```

### Server side 
1. open another terminal in the project root

3. add dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

3. Run the server - first mode - start

```
$ npm run start
```

4. second mode - Development: You can run the server while detecting changes in the server side (the application will update)

```
$ npm run dev
```
